## Ingredients

- 2 medium eggs
- 125ml vegetable oil
- 250ml semi-skimmed milk
- 250g golden caster sugar
- 400g self-raising flour (or same quantity plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder)
- 1 tsp salt
- 150g blueberries

## Method

### Step 1

Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line 2 muffin trays with paper muffin cases. In a large bowl beat 2 medium eggs lightly with a handheld electric mixer for 1 min.

### Step 2

Add 125ml vegetable oil and 250ml semi-skimmed milk and beat until just combined then add 250g golden caster sugar and whisk until you have a smooth batter.

### Step 3

Sift in 400g self-raising flour and 1 tsp salt (or 400g plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder if using) then mix until just smooth. Be careful not to over-mix the batter as this will make the muffins tough.

### Step 4

Stir in 150g blueberries.

### Step 5

Fill muffin cases two-thirds full and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen, firm to the touch and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. If the trays will not fit on 1 shelf, swap the shelves around after 15 mins of cooking.

### Step 6

Leave the muffins in the tin to cool for a few mins and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
