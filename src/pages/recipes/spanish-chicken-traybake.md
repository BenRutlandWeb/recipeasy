A chicken tray bake full of sunshine flavours. If you’d prefer not to use sherry, substitute with chicken stock instead.

This bright chicken tray bake recipe uses red and yellow peppers, tomatoes, olives, paprika, chorizo and sherry.

If you don't like sherry, or just want to keep the cost down, use chicken stock instead - there's still plenty of flavour here.

It only takes 20-minutes to prep this dish and if you serve it with a crisp green salad it's perfect for a relaxed summer dinner party.

A decent loaf of crusty bread will also be a welcome addition to mop up the spicy juices.

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 red onions, each cut into 8 wedges
- 500g baby new potatoes, halved if large
- 8 chicken thigh fillets
- 1/2 tsp sweet smoked paprika
- 1 each red and yellow pepper, deseeded and sliced
- 4 tomatoes, quartered
- 125g chorizo ring, sliced into rounds
- 50g pitted black olives
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 50ml fino or manzanilla sherry, optional

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 200°C (180°C fan) mark 6. Toss the oil, onions, potatoes and some seasoning in a large roasting tin. Roast for 30min.
2. Slash the top of each chicken thigh a couple of times and sprinkle over the paprika and plenty of freshly ground black pepper.
3. Mix the peppers, tomatoes, chorizo, olives and garlic into the roasting tin and sprinkle over the oregano. Sit the chicken on top and add the sherry, if using.
4. Continue roasting for 40-45min, basting the chicken midway through with any juices in the pan. Serve with a crisp green salad and some bread to mop up the juices, if you like.
