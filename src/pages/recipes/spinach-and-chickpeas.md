## Ingredients

- 900g fresh spinach
- 150g cooked chickpeas
- 1 small onion
- 4 garlic cloves
- 2 slices of stale white bread
- 5-6 tablespoons tomato puree
- 1tsp sweet smoked paprika
- 2tsp cumin
- sherry vinegar
- extra virgin olive oil
- salt

## Method

1. Boil the spinach for about 5 or 6 minutes and set aside, a bit soggy is better.
2. Heat 4-5 table spoons of extra virgin olive oil in a large frying pan. Fry the garlic on low heat until golden brown, fish it out and put it into a pestle.
3. Dice and fry the bread in the same oil and then take to the pestle too when is nice and crunchy. Crush together and add a tablespoon of the spinach water to form a paste.
4. In the same pan, fry the chopped onion with a pinch of salt until it is a bit caramelized. Then, add smoked paprika and cumin and stir in the chickpeas. Add 5-6 tablespoons of crushed tomatoes/tomato puree and cook it for 2 minutes, until the oil separates a bit.
5. Next, add the boiled spinach with some of the spinach water, the bread paste, a teaspoon of salt or a little more if you like, another teaspoon of cumin and a teaspoon of sherry vinegar to the pan.
6. Mix well and cook until the liquid reduces, so you get a creamy stew.
7. Let it seat for 10 minutes before serving.
