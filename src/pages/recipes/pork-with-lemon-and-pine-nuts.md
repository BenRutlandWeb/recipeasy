## Ingredients

- 500g pork fillet
- large handful of flat leaf parsley, coarsely chopped
- seasoned flour
- 25g pine nuts
- grated zest of 1/2 lemon and juice of a whole lemon
- 1 tbsp clear honey

## Method

1. Cut the pork into 2cm thick slices. Toss in seasoned flour to coat very lightly and shake of the excess.
2. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large frying pan and fry the pork in a single layer for a few minutes on each side or until browned. Remove from the pan and keep warm.
3. Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan and fry the pine nuts until lightly browned. Stir in the lemon zest, juice and honey. Bubble and stir briefly to make a sauce.
4. Return the pork to the pan and add the parsley. Continue to cook for another few minutes to heat through.
5. Serve with buttered papperdelle or tagliatelle.
