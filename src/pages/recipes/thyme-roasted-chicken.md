## Ingredients

- 450g potatoes
- 1 red onion
- 2 carrots
- 1 red pepper
- 2 chicken breasts
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp dried thyme
- 100ml water
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 32g sweet chilli sauce
- A few sprigs flat leaf parsley

## Method

1. Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. Chop the potatoes into 2cm wide wedges, pop the wedges onto a large baking tray. Drizzle with oil, season with salt and pepper then toss to coat. Spread out in a single layer. Roast on the middle shelf until golden for 30-40 mins turning halfway through.

2. Meanwhile, halve and peel the red onion, then cut each half into 3 wedges. Trim the carrots, then halve lengthways. Chop into roughly 1cm wide, 5cm long batons. Halve the pepper and discard the core and seeds. Slice into 1cm wide strips. Roughly chop the parsley (stalks and all).

3. Put the chicken into a bowl with the olive oil and half the dried thyme. Season with salt and pepper, mix together then set aside. Put the onion, carrots and peppers onto a baking tray. Drizzle with oil, sprinkle on the remaining dried thyme and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat, then roast on the top shelf of your oven until soft and golden, 25-30 mins. turn halfway through.

4. Fry the chicken in a pan with a little oil until browned on both sides, 3-5 mins each side. Once the veg has been in the oven for 10 mins, pop the chicken on top and roast for the remaining 15-20 mins.

5. Add the water and chicken stock paste in a pan and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1-2 mins. Add the sweet chilli sauce and stir well to combine. Simmer the mixture until thickened and glossy, 3-4 mins, then remove from the heat.

6. Toss together the wedges and roasted veg. Transfer to your plates and arrange the chicken (cut into slices) on top. Spoon over the sweet chilli glaze, scatter with parsley and serve.
