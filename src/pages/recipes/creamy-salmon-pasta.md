| **Preparation time:** | 15 minutes |
| **Cook time:**        | 15 minutes |

## Ingredients

- 2 salmon fillets
- 1 tbsp olive oil, plus 1 tsp if roasting
- 175g penne
- 2 shallots or 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 100ml white wine
- 200ml double cream or crème fraîche
- 1/4 lemon, zested and juiced
- 1/2 small bunch dill, finely chopped

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 180C, place the salmon on a baking tray, drizzle with oil and roast for 12 mins.
2. While the salmon is cooking, boil the pasta for 10 mins until al dente, then drain, reserving 100ml of the pasta water.
3. Heat the oil on a medium heat in a wide frying pan and fry the shallots for 6 mins until softened. Add the garlic and fry for a minute more until fragrant.
4. Add the wine, bubble for a few minutes until reduced by half, then add the cream and season well. Bring to a very gentle simmer.
5. Flake the cooked salmon into big chunky pieces, leaving the skin behind. Add to the sauce with the cooked pasta.
6. Add the lemon zest, a squeeze of the juice and most of the dill. Toss gently to keep the salmon in big pieces. Serve with a green salad.
