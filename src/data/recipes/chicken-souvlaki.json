  "methods": [
    "Tip the chicken into a large bowl and add the marinade ingredients, along with 1 tsp salt and plenty of black pepper. Mix well, ensuring each thigh is well coated. Cover and chill for at least 3 hrs, or up to 48 hrs if you have time.",
    "Heat the grill to its highest setting. Line a roasting tin with foil and find metal skewers long enough to sit across the top with a little space underneath. Take one thigh and thread it over 2 skewers, so it has a skewer through either side. Thread another piece of chicken on top, leaving a slight gap between each piece; you should fit 6 thighs on each pair of skewers. Position the skewers on top of the roasting tin and set aside while you finish the pittas.",
    "Heat the pitta wraps as per the packet instructions and keep warm in the bottom of the oven while you cook the chicken.",
    "Put the chicken under the hot grill and cook for 15-20 mins, brushing with oil and any juices from the bottom of the tin regularly, and turning halfway through cooking. Once cooked, remove from the oven and rest for 5 mins. Alternatively you can cook the chicken skewers on the barbecue.",
    "Cut through each pair of skewers to make seperate kebabs and serve in the warm bread, with lettuce, tomato, red onion, lemon wedges and tzatziki."
