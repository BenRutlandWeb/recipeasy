        "Boil the spinach for about 5 or 6 minutes and set aside, a bit soggy is better.",
        "Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large frying pan. Fry the garlic on low heat until golden brown, fish it out and put it into a pestle.",
        "Dice and fry the bread in the same oil and then take to the pestle too when is nice and crunchy. Crush together and add a tbsp of the spinach water to form a paste.",
        "In the same pan, fry the chopped onion with a pinch of salt until it is a bit caramelized. Then, add smoked paprika and half the cumin and stir in the chickpeas. Add tomato puree and cook it for 2 minutes, until the oil separates a bit.",
        "Next, add the boiled spinach with some of the spinach water, the bread paste, a tsp of salt or a little more if you like, the rest of the cumin and some sherry vinegar to the pan.",
        "Mix well and cook until the liquid reduces, so you get a creamy stew.",
        "Let it sit for 10 minutes before serving."
