    "Bring a pan of salted water to a boil for cooking the spaghetti. Once boiling add the pasta and begin to cook. Meanwhile in a large frying pan over a medium heat add the butter and allow to melt.",
    "Add the finely chopped garlic to the melted butter and a good pinch of chilli flakes. Gently fry until fragrant.",
    "Add the cooked mussels and simmer them gently in the butter to heat through. Add a grind of black pepper and a tiny bit of salt (the mussels are already salty so don't add a lot). Check on the pasta.",
    "Stir the mussels so that they are coated in the butter garlic and chilli sauce evenly. Turn down the heat to low.",
    "Drain off the spaghetti once el dente and add into the frying pan with the mussels using tongs gently toss everything together. Add the parsley and a touch more pepper. Toss until every strand is coated in the butter sauce. Serve up immediately and enjoy!"
