    "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line 2 muffin trays with paper muffin cases. In a large bowl beat the eggs lightly with a handheld electric mixer for 1 min.",
    "Add the vegetable oil and semi-skimmed milk and beat until just combined then add golden caster sugar and whisk until you have a smooth batter.",
    "Sift in self-raising flour and salt then mix until just smooth. Be careful not to over-mix the batter as this will make the muffins tough. Stir in the blueberries.",
    "Fill the muffin cases two-thirds full and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen, firm to the touch and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean.",
    "Leave the muffins in the tin to cool for a few mins and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."
