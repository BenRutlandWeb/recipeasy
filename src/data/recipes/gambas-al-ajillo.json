    "Using a small sharp knife, shell the prawns, leaving just the very end of the tails on. Sprinkle the meat with a pinch of salt and set aside.",
    "Peel the garlic and squash two of the cloves with the flat of a large knife. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat, then add the squashed garlic and the prawn shells and heads.",
    "Fry, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until the shells are a deep pink, making sure the garlic doesn’t burn. Meanwhile, finely slice the remaining garlic.",
    "Pass the oil through a sieve and discard the solids. Return the oil to the pan over a medium-high heat and add the chillies.",
    "Fry for a minute or so, then add the prawns. Cook for a minute more, then add the garlic and cook, stirring, for a further minute – the prawns should be just cooked through.",
    "Stir the vinegar into the prawn head bowl, then stir this mix into the pan, along with the parsley. Season and serve at once with plenty of bread."
