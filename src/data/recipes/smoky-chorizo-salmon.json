  "methods": [
    "Put the salmon flesh side down in a large cold non-stick frying pan and place on a medium-high heat.",
    "As the pan comes up to temperature and the salmon begins to sizzle (about 3 minutes), flip it over and cook on the skin side for 5 minutes, or until very crisp and just cooked (depending on its thickness).",
    "Meanwhile, halve the cherry tomatoes, tear up most of the basil leaves, then toss it all with the red wine vinegar and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper.",
    "Squash the olives and discard the stones, then finely chop the flesh. Mix with the extra virgin olive oil and a splash of water.",
    "Finely slice the chorizo, add to the pan for the last 2 minutes, then toss in the dressed tomatoes for 30 seconds.",
    "Divide between your plates, with the salmon on top. Spoon over the dressed olives, pick over the remaining basil and served with cooked green beans."
